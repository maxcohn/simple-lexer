I made this on a boring night while wanting to write some code. I used to be
intimidated by each step in compiler design, but I've become a lot more
knowledgeable, and the best way to learn is to do. I figure if I implement this
once, the next time I do will be easier and better. My end goal is to one day
write a compiler (probably C because who doesn't love C?).

This isn't something I care too heavily about, so it probably won't be maintained
and probably isn't the best for actual use. This is more of a neat little project
to fill a night's time.
